# Abstract
Graphs offer a generic abstraction for modeling entities and the
interactions and relationships between them. Since most realworld
graphs evolve over time, there is a need for models to
explore the evolution of graphs over time. In this paper, we introduce
the GraphTempo model that allows aggregation both at the
attribute and at the time dimension.
