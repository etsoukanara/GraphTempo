**Paper**: Evangelia Tsoukanara, Georgia Koloniari, and Evaggelia Pitoura. GraphTempo: An aggregation framework for evolving graphs.

## Abstract
Graphs offer a generic abstraction for modeling entities and the interactions and relationships between them. Since most real world graphs evolve over time, there is a need for models to explore the evolution of graphs over time. In this paper, we introduce the GraphTempo model that allows aggregation both at the attribute and at the time dimension.We also propose an exploration strategy for navigating through the evolution of the graph based on identifying time intervals of significant growth, shrinkage or stability.

## General Information
This repository facilitates both temporal and attribute aggregation by introducing a set of temporal projections and enabling aggregation on static, time-varying node attributes and combinations of them. Also, provide an exploratory strategy to assess the evolution of the graph in terms of _stability_, _shrinkage_, and _growth_. The datasets used in this paper is provided in 'datasets',

## Dependencies
Python 3.8
